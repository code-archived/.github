<h1 align = "center">Code Archive</h1>

<div align = "justify">

A dummy organization (or rather a group) is created to keep all my old archived projects. These are typically dropped projects, or the same is moved to a new/better version
(check source/README.md for more information on such a project). Once a repository is deleted, all its file history and code contributions are omitted by default in GitHub,
thus this group of project is kept mainly to keep the contributions alive and maybe for personal back reference.
